## What will be the git branching strategy? (elaborate options with pros and cons)

Recommendation: Given the team size and continuous release goal, (Trunk-Based Development) would be more suitable. It promotes faster integration and aligns better with continuous delivery practices.

**Trunk-Based Development with Short-Lived Feature Branches**

- Main branch: main or master (trunk).
- Feature branches: feature/* (short-lived).

**Pros:**
- Simplifies CI/CD pipeline configuration.
- Encourages frequent integrations and deployments.
- Reduces merge conflicts and integration issues.
- Aligns well with containerization and microservices architecture.

**Cons:**
- Requires robust testing.
- May be challenging for less experienced teams.

## Which tool you will consider for CI/CD?

From a DevOps standpoint, for a startup I recommend GitLab CI/CD for this scenario.
**Pros:**
- Native integration with Git, supporting multi-repo projects.
- Built-in container registry and package management.
- Supports infrastructure-as-code for pipeline definitions.
- Offers free tier with essential features.

**Cons:**
- May require some learning curve.
- Self-hosted option requires additional maintenance.
- Advanced features might need paid plans.


Alternative options could include Jenkins (more customizable but requires more maintenance) or GitHub Actions (if using GitHub for repositories).

## What will be your build promotion plans (Dev - QA - Prod)?

**Dev Stage**

Trigger: Commit to feature branch.

- Run automated tests (unit, integration).
- Static code analysis.
- Build Docker image.
- Push image to container registry with dev tag.

Auto-deploy to ephemeral environment.

- Use Kubernetes for orchestration.
- Deploy using Helm charts.

Generate and store test reports and metrics.
Destroy ephemeral environment on completion.

**QA Stage**

Trigger: Merge to main or master branch.

- Rebuild Docker image with qa tag.
- Deploy to persistent QA environment.

Run full suite of automated tests.

- Integration tests.
- Performance tests.
- Security scans.


Trigger chaos engineering tests.

Simulate failures using tools like Chaos Monkey.


Generate comprehensive test reports.

Notify QA team for manual testing if required.

Update status in issue tracking system.

**Prod Stage**

Trigger: Manual approval or automated based on QA metrics.

Pre-deployment:

- Verify all required approvals.
- Check compliance requirements.


Deploy:

- Use blue/green deployment strategy.
- Utilize Kubernetes for orchestration.
- Implement canary releases (10% traffic initially).


Post-deployment:

- Run smoke tests.
- Monitor error rates, performance metrics.
- Gradually increase traffic to 100%.


Rollback plan:

- Ability to quickly rollback to previous version if issues detected

Continuous Monitoring

- Set up centralized Monitoring and logging (example: New Relic, ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana).
- Configure alerts for critical metrics.

## Provide CI/CD implementation plans with stages.

Terraform CI/CD Implementation Plan.

Stage 1: Code Validation. 

Trigger: Push to any branch.
Actions:
- Run terraform fmt -check to ensure consistent formatting.

Artifacts: Linting and validation reports.

Stage 2: Security Scanning.

Trigger: Successful Code Validation.
Actions:

- Scan Terraform code for security issues using tools like tfsec.
- Check for hardcoded secrets using git-secrets or similar tools.
- Perform IAM analysis to ensure least privilege principle.

Artifacts: Security scan reports.

Stage 3: Plan Generation.

Trigger: Successful Security Scanning
Actions:

- Initialize Terraform working directory (terraform init).
- Execute terraform validate to check for syntax errors.
- Generate and display Terraform plan (terraform plan).
- Store plan artifacts for later use.

Artifacts: Terraform plan output.

Stage 4: Apply (example: terraform apply).

Trigger: Successful Plan Generation
Actions:

- Apply Terraform changes to production environment
- Implement blue/green deployment if applicable
- Run comprehensive post-deployment tests


Continuous Processes

State Management:

- Use remote state storage (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking)
- Implement state versioning and backup strategies

Secret Management:

- Integrate with vault solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate credentials regularly

## How will you manage module version dependencies?

From a DevOps perspective, managing module version dependencies in a multi-repo setup involves:

- Use a package manager (e.g., Artifactory, Nexus) to store and manage internal module packages.
- Create a central configuration repository for managing dependency versions across all modules.
- Use Docker multi-stage builds to manage build-time dependencies.
- Use a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for runtime dependency management and traffic control.
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of dependency updates.
- Use GitOps practices to manage environment-specific dependencies.
- Implement automated compatibility testing between modules as part of the CI pipeline.
